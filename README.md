# Data-Science-R

Following are some of the data science projects/assignments that I did using R programming language. Essential topics covered here are - Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis with R, Supervised Machine Learning Problem, ML Interpretations and Feature Selection Techniques in R - Regression Analysis and Classification Analysis, Unsupervised Machine Learning Problem in R - PCA, Clustering Analysis, Recommendation Engine.

1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on Public Utility Companies based in USA.
2. Regression Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression with Feature Selection Techniques for Airfares Prediction 
3. Classification Analysis - Spam Classifier using LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
4. Hitters Salary Prediction using Decision Tree (Regression Tree) and Ensemble Methods


Note : Each of these folders contain a .rmd (R Markdown document) which consists of the code written in R and .md (a readme file) which consists of the output - results, interpretation and explanation.
